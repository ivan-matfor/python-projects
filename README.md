# python-projects

A curated collection of data science and machine learning projects developed in Python.  
This repository serves as a portfolio to showcase practical skills in data analysis, model development, and real-world problem solving.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder and may include:
- A brief project description (`README.md`)
- Jupyter notebooks and/or Python scripts
- Datasets or links to data sources
- Visualizations and results
- (Optional) Model files and requirements

## üîç Example Topics

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Regression and Classification Models
- Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Time Series Analysis
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Deep Learning (e.g. with TensorFlow or PyTorch)

## üí° Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch (project dependent)
- Streamlit or Gradio (for some visual demos)
- Git for version control

## üéØ Purpose

This repository was created to:
